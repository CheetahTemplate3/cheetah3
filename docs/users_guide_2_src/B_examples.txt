The Cheetah distribution comes with an 'examples' directory.  Browse the
files in this directory and its subdirectories for examples of how
Cheetah can be used.

\subsection{Syntax examples}
The \code{Cheetah.Tests} module contains a large number of test cases that can
double as examples of how the Cheetah Language works.  To view these cases go
to the base directory of your Cheetah distribution and open the file
\code{Cheetah/Tests/SyntaxAndOutput.py} in a text editor.

\subsection{Webware Examples}
For examples of Cheetah in use with Webware visit the Cheetah and Webware wikis
or use google.  We used to have more examples in the cheetah source tarball, but
they were out of date and confused people.
