Abstract
--------
One can consider the basis for all CHEP documents to be
modeled after `PEP #1 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/>`_,
for this reason you should refer to `PEP #1 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/>`_
for the true CHEP "purpose and guidelines" instead of them being
enumerated here (and duplicated).
