Below is a simple example of some Cheetah code, as you can see it's practically
Python. You can import, inherit and define methods just like in a regular Python
module, since that's what your Cheetah templates are compiled to :) ::

    #from Cheetah.Template import Template
    #extends Template

    #set $people = [{'name' : 'Tom', 'mood' : 'Happy'}, {'name' : 'Dick',
                            'mood' : 'Sad'}, {'name' : 'Harry', 'mood' : 'Hairy'}]

    <strong>How are you feeling?</strong>
    <ul>
        #for $person in $people
            <li>
                $person['name'] is $person['mood']
            </li>
        #end for
    </ul>
